TwitchPlaysPokemon Park
=======================

TPP Park is a museum of all the memorable moments that took place over the year that TwitchPlaysPokemon ran for, not just including the world-remembered Red run, but every run performed thereafter until its Season 1 conclusion with Pokemon OmegaRuby. 

If you came here looking for the source code, you'll be slightly disappointed. Version 2 of the park is complied, to *drastically* reduce the number of file downloads when playing the game (if increasing the size for each of those). In this repository, you'll only find those compiled files, all nicely bundled up. You're free to look through the minified code and packaged map files, if that fascinates you, but if you want to see and work on the pre-compiled files, go over to [the TPPParkDev Repository](https://github.com/tustin2121/TPPParkDev). More information will be available there.
