TwitchPlaysPokemon Park
=======================

TPP Park is essentially a museum of all the memorable moments that took place over the year 
that TwitchPlaysPokemon ran for, not just including the world-remembered Red run, but every
run performed thereafter until its Season 1 conclusion with Pokemon OmegaRuby. 

There are no plans to add anything from Season 2 to the park, simply because I was dogged 
endlessly to add things to version 1 of the park and I don't want a repeat of that. If I 
add anything to the park after it is declared complete, it will be on a whim.

Version 2.x
-----------
Version 2 of the park is a complete overhaul of the concept. The focus is not so much 
documenting pokemon we had, but more recreating experiences we enjoyed. The primary difference
between Versions 1 and 2 is the conversion of format from a web page you can look around
to a video game format wherein you control a character. The first most noticable contribution
of this change is the inclusion of "your chat".

The chat, referenced as "your chat" to differentiate it from the live stream's chat, and
also embodying the fact that there is only one instance of this chat that only the player 
can see, is a simulation of the chat from the stream. Its main purpose is to recreate the
chaos of having the chat react to things on your screen with memes, copypasta, directions, 
and all of their usual reactions. The chat is designed to look like it is watching/playing
YOUR experience of walking around the park, right down to the fact that when you move, your
movements are mimiced in the chat window as "up", "down", "a", etc.

The secondary focus of version 2 is the retelling of stories by means of "Show, don't Tell".
Version 1's only means of telling a visitor about Aoooo buying hundreds of pokeballs is to 
talk about it in the Infodex. Version 2, however, is built so that when the player enters
the PokeMart, he will occasionally come across Aoooo at the counter, buying hundreds of balls
"to catch more fwends wiff", and the player will later find a dump truck full of pokeballs
parked next to the Mart, so they can restock. And, of course, while talking to Aoooo, she'll
randomly glitch out, drawing "AOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO"'s from your chat.

The Wiki
--------
In a vain attempt to allow others to help more easily, I will try and keep the wiki of this
repository up-to-date with definitions of classes and explinations of intentions.
