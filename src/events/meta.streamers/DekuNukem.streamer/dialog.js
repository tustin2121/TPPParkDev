//https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uy4W4ORDvqA  -- Deku plays ocarina songs
// You are teleported to a recreation or rip of Lake Hylia at night. Deku stands atop
// a pedistol like in the stream and begins to play the first song. After each song, you
// are given a choice on what song to play, but you may only play each song once.
//
// This will initiate a chat context where it plays back the chat from this event
// 
// The last song is labeled "Grand Finale" and it'll transport the player back to 
// the Streamer's Chamber once completed.
