Crystal Flats

# Description
Crystal Flats is an apartment building that houses 4 apartments on the west side 
of South Surldab City. Those who live here usually have some association with the
Crystal run.

Note: the building model is designed such that when the camera is outside an
apartment, the camera cannot see into the apartment. However, when the player
walks into an apartment, the camera passes through the barrier wall, allowing 
full view of the apartment (but not the hall). The halls into the apartments are
long to allow this transition, with walking warps between the outside and inside,
to disallow the player stopping halfway in-between.

The apartments are not all open for anyone to walk into all the time. The player 
must interact with the door to "knock", and if the apartment is currently accepting
guests, the door will swing open and shuffle the player inside.


First Floor: Pigu's Flat
Pigdevil2010's apartment is on the first floor of the building. When he's not at the
TPPLeague, he's usually here at home. When he's in, he'll likely be working on various
rom hacks or drawing something. 

His computer has the tpp stream running on it. It is not unlike the stream implemented
in his TPP Red hack.


Second Floor: Burrito's Flat
Burrito and LazerGator often hang out here in off-times. Burrito will allow the player in
at any time of day when he's in. His apartment is very much a "love" flat, with a slight
70's vibe to it. Here you'll find an archive of the more risque fan fictions.


Third Floor: AJ and Joey's Flat
AJ's apartment is a more modern, wood and exposed metal struts-type apartment (not unlike 
Logan's apartment in GG Season 6). They've got a couch, TV, and a table with seats for four.
They also have a PC, and Joey will mention how AJ usually avoids using the PC if he can.

It has a singular bed in a separate room. You'll often find Joey or AJ sleeping in here
when the other one invites you in. Joey goes to sleep early (9pm), while AJ manages to finally
get to sleep late at night (1am) and wakes later on. You'll never see both sleeping at the 
same time because *someone* has to answer the door. 


Fourth Floor: For Let
[This apartment is empty for future expansion.]
