Crystal Flats

# Description
Crystal Flats is an apartment building that houses 4 apartments on the west side of South Surldab City. Those who live here usually have some association with the Crystal run.

Note: the building model is designed such that when the camera is outside an apartment, the camera cannot see into the apartment. However, when the player walks into an apartment, the camera passes through the barrier wall, allowing full view of the apartment (but not the hall). The halls into the apartments are long to allow this transition, with walking warps between the outside and inside, to disallow the player stopping halfway in-between.

The apartments are not all open for anyone to walk into all the time. The player must interact with the door to "knock", and if the apartment is currently accepting guests, the door will swing open and shuffle the player inside.


First Floor: Pigu's Flat
------------------------
Pigdevil2010's apartment is on the first floor of the building. When he's not at the TPPLeague, he's usually here at home. When he's in, he'll likely be working on various rom hacks or drawing something. 

His computer has the tpp stream running on it. It is not unlike the stream implemented in his TPP Red hack.


Second Floor: Burrito's Flat
----------------------------
Burrito and LazerGator often hang out here in off-times. Burrito will allow the player in at any time of day when he's in. His apartment is very much a "love" flat, with a slight 70's vibe to it. Here you'll find an archive of the more risque fan fictions.

This may also be where you can learn about TwitchDatesPokemon.


Third Floor: AJ and Joey's Flat
-------------------------------
AJ's apartment is a more modern, wood and exposed metal struts-type apartment (not unlike Logan's apartment in GG Season 6). They've got a couch, TV, and a table with seats for four. They also have a PC, and Joey will mention how AJ usually avoids using the PC if he can.

It has a singular bed in a separate room. You'll often find Joey or AJ sleeping in here when the other one invites you in. Joey goes to sleep early (9pm), while AJ manages to finally get to sleep late at night (1am) and wakes later on. You'll never see both sleeping at the same time because *someone* has to answer the door. 


Fourth Floor: For Let
---------------------
[This apartment is empty for future expansion.]
