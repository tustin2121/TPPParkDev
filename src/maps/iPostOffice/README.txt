Kenyan Post Office

# Description

The Kenyan Post Office is a wearhouse that acts as the post office for the park. 
Kenya, taking up two tiles where most others take up one, is BIG, and must be
provided his own door and work space. When Kenya goes through the streets to
deliver mail, he'll exit through that door and must do 2-space path finding to
get to his delivery locations. All the mailboxes are built such that Kenya can
easily access them from a path that is at least two wide.

The wearhouse has a high area in the front, where some underling pokemon work.
- Crabslash - a HG pokemon who was supposed to be a Krabby.
- Root on a segway - Occasionally Lilleep will show up as a worker there, riding 
	a segway.
- "Bexbird" (A Delibird) - 

Postmaster Kenya has a desk in the back, on a lower floor. His desk is massive,
and has a picture of Aoooo on it.

Aoooo will occasionally show up to talk with Kenya when he's in. 

Arty will occasionally show up to personally give Kenya some Lava Cookies and water.

Napoleon will occasionally show up to buy some "chain-mail" armor for the Court of the Sun.
