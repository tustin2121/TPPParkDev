Burrito's Fanfiction Emporium

# Description

A book store wherein burrito's fan fictions are kept and "sold". The player can come 
through here and browse around, examining the various fan fictions written by real people.

The shelves on the lower level are ceiling-height shelves that contain fan fiction works
categorized by author name. The shelves have signs on them indicating letters in the particular
aisles. Patrons browse the aisle as well, stopping to sit and read on a particular letter
occasionally. You'll sometimes find GYMC looking through some fictions.

The upper level has higher ceilings and is somewhat brighter. It has a small reading area, 
where patrons sit on floor pillows and read, or listen to stories told by others.

The southern part of the upper floor has a meet-and-greet area, where people get signed 
copies of books. Occasionally, featured artists will appear here, and you can read their
works from the table.
